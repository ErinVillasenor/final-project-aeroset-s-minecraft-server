# Purpose and Explanation
This architecture was chosen based on the third assignment. It also makes
sense in theory. Separating each piece of the architecture in to blocks
or processes that need to act upon the request, the design works to segment
the tasks. However, it is not complete as Routes still remains larger than
the other components.

I think we will break this down more during the development, but it will
definitely be a struggling point for the group. I think ExpressJS will help
with the complexity alongside good interfaces for the other blocks.

Each part will be seperated amongst the group members. This will ease work
and also help with testing the different components. Every block has it's 
own interface that is seperate from the other. So testing will be as easy
as development. It will also have seperate directories in the project. All
in all this style of development has many pros!
