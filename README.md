A project for CS493 Cloud Application Development course for Oregon State Spring 2020, this is a RESTful API using Javascript, Docker, SQL, and Node.js.
Using an application like Postman, the user is able to interact with the Web service, which is meant to be a Canvas-like application where users were organized into
different roles (e.g. students, instructors, admins), could submit "assignment" files, and were signed up for courses. Roles like instructors and admins required authentication
via a token system.
